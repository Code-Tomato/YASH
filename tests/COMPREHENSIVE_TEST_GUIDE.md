./run_tests.sh test
```

### Running Specific Test Categories

```bash
# Build and run tests
make test

# The test runner will execute all tests in order
```

### Test Output

The test suite provides detailed output showing:
- Test execution progress
- Pass/fail status for each test
- Summary statistics
- Any error messages

## Test Requirements Coverage

### File Redirection Requirements
✅ **Input redirection** (`<`) - Creates stdin from file
✅ **Output redirection** (`>`) - Creates stdout to file  
✅ **Error redirection** (`2>`) - Creates stderr to file
✅ **File creation** - Output files created if they don't exist
✅ **Input validation** - Fails if input file doesn't exist
✅ **Multiple redirections** - All three types per command
✅ **Redirection order** - After command and arguments

### Piping Requirements
✅ **Simple pipes** (`|`) - Separates two commands
✅ **Pipeline execution** - Left command stdout to right command stdin
✅ **Process groups** - Children in same pipeline group
✅ **Simultaneous execution** - Pipeline commands start/stop together
✅ **Single pipe limit** - Maximum one `|` per command
✅ **Pipe with redirections** - Both commands can have redirections

### Signal Handling Requirements
✅ **SIGINT (Ctrl+C)** - Quits foreground process, not shell
✅ **SIGTSTP (Ctrl+Z)** - Sends SIGTSTP to foreground process
✅ **SIGCHLD** - Handles child process termination
✅ **Shell protection** - Shell not stopped by SIGTSTP
✅ **Signal forwarding** - Signals sent to foreground processes

### Job Control Requirements
✅ **Background execution** (`&`) - Single command only
✅ **Mutual exclusivity** - `|` and `&` cannot be combined
✅ **fg command** - Brings most recent job to foreground
✅ **bg command** - Continues most recent stopped job
✅ **jobs command** - Shows job control table
✅ **Job numbering** - Follows bash numbering scheme
✅ **Job status** - Shows Running/Stopped/Done status
✅ **Maximum jobs** - 20 jobs maximum

### Input Restrictions
✅ **Token spacing** - All tokens have spaces before/after
✅ **Redirection order** - Redirections follow command and args
✅ **Background position** - `&` always last token
✅ **Line length** - Maximum 2000 characters
✅ **Token length** - Maximum 30 characters per token
✅ **ASCII only** - All characters are ASCII
✅ **Invalid commands** - Commands starting with `<`, `>`, `2>`, `|`, `&` fail

- Memory usage is reasonable
- No memory leaks occur
- Complex commands don't cause significant delays

## Memory Safety

Tests ensure:
- No buffer overflows occur
- NULL pointers are handled safely
- Memory is properly managed
- No memory leaks in parsing

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to work with:
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Local development testing
- Automated testing on multiple platforms
- Memory leak detection with Valgrind
- Code coverage analysis

## Usage Examples

### Basic Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
./run_tests.sh coverage

# Run with memory checking
./run_tests.sh valgrind
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Build and test
make all-setup

# Format code
make format

# Generate documentation
make docs
```

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test function in appropriate test file
2. Add function declaration to test_runner.c
3. Add RUN_TEST call to main() function
4. Ensure test follows naming convention: `test_<feature>_<scenario>`

### Test Naming Convention
- `test_parse_<scenario>` - Parsing tests
- `test_<feature>_<scenario>` - Feature-specific tests
- `test_<feature>_edge_<scenario>` - Edge case tests
- `test_<feature>_error_<scenario>` - Error condition tests

### Test Organization
- Group related tests together
- Use descriptive test names
- Include comments explaining complex test scenarios
- Follow consistent assertion patterns
